# example set >>> set()
#set in python are mutable datatype. however, every elements of a set
#must be immutable
# set doesn't support indexing and slicing
# set elements are always unique
# set are unordered 

# creating an empty set
a=set()
#creating non-empty set
data = {1,2,3,4}
fruits={"apple","mango","orange","banana"}
a={1, "a", (1,2) , 1.1}
print(a)
a={[1,2],3}# this raise an error cause list is mutable
